# Outstanding work (from 7 Nov 2026)

Everything still open across the D'thorga mods, as the owner decided it on 7 November 2026, when they asked for every open item as a
question. **Keep this file current:** every change that starts, finishes or defers an item updates it in the same commit. In-game
testing is the owner's and is not listed here; each mod's changelog says what is tested.

**Status key:** open, in progress, done (with the version), deferred (with the reason).

## This round, in order

## Deferred

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Hydrogen as a room gas, and the four vents (extractor fan, passive vent, fume hood, hydrogen detector) | The owner left it out of this round (7 Nov 2026); [ventilation and hydrogen](ventilation-and-hydrogen.md) |
| Radio Framework: the three defaults of 19 Oct, licence tiers, Phase 2, the public name | "Later, when I have a better idea of everything" (owner, 7 Nov 2026) |
| D'thorga treatments for IRBM's other strategic warheads | After the owner has tested the nuke |
| Generated art (the store's frost, the electrolyser, the chamber redraw, a whip, the radio base station, the new equipment) | Only on the owner's "go"; new pieces ship with scripted placeholders |
| A base class for interval map components in the Framework | Would change the timing code of parts the owner has tested; waits until one is changed for its own sake |
| Workshop publication tooling | At the first public beta, per AGENTS.md |
