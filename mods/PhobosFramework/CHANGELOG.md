# D'thorga Framework changelog

Maintained from 4 November 2026. Draft entries record preparation, not Steam publication; nothing is published yet. Not yet
tested in game unless an entry says the owner tested it.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-04 - Draft

### Fixed

- The load report threw at startup ("Could not execute post-long-event action") because the Combat Extended smoke check read
  the tick manager before any game existed, and took D'thorga Burns and Smoke's load line down with it. The check now reads
  the setting directly outside a game. Seen in the owner's Player.log on 4 November 2026; the fix is not yet tested in game.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04 - Draft

The owner's shared framework, started for D'thorga Burns and Smoke and recorded as a future idea on 22 October 2026. Not yet
tested in game.

### Added

- The gas layer. One way for a mod to read what a pawn breathes: smoke from Combat Extended's own smoke inhalation condition
  while that runs (its masks, sleep and breathing capacity included), otherwise the game's own smoke at the cell through the
  pawn's toxic environment resistance or a gas-mask tag; tox gas, rot stink and deadlife dust from the game's grid.
- Fires fill roofed rooms with the game's own smoke whenever Combat Extended's smoke is not in use, so burning buildings are
  smoky without it, with the game's own spread through open doors, slower fading under a roof, and its aim and sight penalties.
- The framework's own additive room gases: one mixture per room that exists only while something adds it, exchanged through
  open and closed doors and switched-on vents at the game's own door and vent rates, vented through roof gaps and doors to
  the outdoors, fading at each gas's half-life, emptied by vacuum, kept across wall changes through the cells it covered, and
  saved as cells. No air, oxygen or pressure model.
- Carbon monoxide as the first own gas: fires add it to their roofed room; it ignores filter masks and lingers for hours.
- The owner's rule as a setting, "Where gases come from": Automatic reuses existing gases and effects and uses the
  framework's own where nothing else carries one; Always own and Never override it. A gas Def can pin itself to own.
- An XML-only emitter comp, a dev-mode overlay and two dev actions.
- Shared helpers: optional mods and Defs by name, the one-line load report, the Plain, Operator and Engineer display mode and
  its settings radio, a rules-Def base whose first instance wins, the D'thorga debug category, and a cleanup service that
  removes a mod's conditions from every pawn before the mod is switched off.

### Dependencies

- None. Combat Extended is reached by name only (its setting, condition and stat names); no other mod's assembly is referenced.
- Built twice: against the 1.7.4998 reference on .NET 10, which leads, and against the 1.6 reference; the game loads its own
  version's folder (1.7/Assemblies or 1.6/Assemblies).

### Save compatibility

- Safe to add mid-game. Saves hold the room gas as cells; a save without the framework loads with no gas. Safe to remove once
  the mods that depend on it are gone; the next load prints one harmless line about a missing map component.

### Compatibility and limits

- Gas does not travel with a gravship. Rooms are found through regions and vents through a room's adjacent things on 1.7;
  not yet confirmed in play. Humanoid Alien Races and other flesh races use the same giver sets and get the same gases.
- Game-free rules pass 17 unit tests. Nothing is tested in game.
